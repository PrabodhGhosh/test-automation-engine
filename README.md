**Overview**

This repository contains a robust, scalable, and maintainable test automation framework designed for web application testing. Built with industry best practices, including the **Page Object Model (POM)** and TestNG, the framework is designed for easy integration into various CI/CD pipelines. It is highly resilient, able to handle transient issues and dynamic web elements, and supports advanced data management for complex test scenarios.

**Key Features**

**#Advanced Data Management:** Supports flexible, structured test data from JSON files, allowing for complex and nested test scenarios.

Resilient Execution: Automatically retries failed tests to mitigate flakiness and uses a custom Fluent Wait utility to gracefully handle dynamic web elements and transient network delays.

Cross-Browser Support: Execute tests on multiple browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

Parallel Execution: Configurable parallel execution of tests to significantly reduce run time.

Advanced Reporting: Generates comprehensive and interactive Extent Reports with test case details, screenshots, and logs.

CI/CD Integration: Ready for integration with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or other CI tools.
